Instructor: Andrew Ng
Introduction
This repo contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera.


Being a compter science major and life-long lenear, I have taken many MOOC from Udemy, Courseera, etc. I know it's tough to take time from a busy schedule and learn new things, and sometime you get stuck so I have uploaded my solutions which are only for refernce purpose. It may help you to save some time. 
And I hope you don't copy any part of the code.
